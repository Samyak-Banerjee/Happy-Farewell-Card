        Dear Cool Seniors of Class 12, Hey, it's your dude from Class 7,
        dropping some mega-good vibes your way as you roll out of here into the
        wild world beyond school. I gotta say, you guys made this place way more
        awesome, and it's gonna be kinda lame without you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wishing you all the raddest adventures and success in whatever comes
        next. Your brainiac moves and hard work have been, like, totally rad
        examples for us little guys. As you bounce into the future, remember the
        cool times, epic victories, and the lessons that hit you harder than
        Balaji Da's math class on a Monday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life's gonna throw some curveballs, but I know you'll totally crush it.
        Keep the good vibes rolling, and may your dreams be as big as that pile
        of homework we all wish would disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for being the legends you are, and don't forget about us juniors
        holding down the fort in Class 7. Catch you on the flip side, seniors!
      </p>
